- ## Objective
	- > Being a tech leader means balancing vision, strategy, and innovation—yet too often, the administrative burden of the role becomes a persistent obstacle, especially for those who found themselves thrust into leadership accidentally or reluctantly. If you're a technical expert navigating the transition into leadership, it's easy to feel overwhelmed by information overload, endless meetings, follow-ups, and scattered responsibilities.
	  >
	  > In this practical, immediately applicable full day workshop, Michael introduces the Digital Knowledge Management (DKM) Tech Leader Toolbox—a proven approach to taming the chaos and reclaiming your clarity, productivity, and sanity. Leveraging Tiago Forte's “Building a Second Brain” methodology combined with powerful tools like Logseq, you'll learn structured workflows to capture, organize, distill, and effortlessly retrieve critical information exactly when you need it.
	  > 
	  > You'll discover how to streamline meeting notes, simplify administrative tasks, track decisions and outcomes, hold your self and your team accountable, and build your personal leadership knowledge base. With these tools and techniques, you'll not only master the administrative aspects of your role but transform them into a powerful advantage. Join us and take control of your leadership journey today!
